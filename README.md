# Telecom-case-study
## Objective: 
Client wants to know what the factors which contribute to churn are. They would like to have a system through which they could identify such customer which could also help them decide who the one who could not be retained are and the customer who could be retained what should be the appropriate incentive for them. They have goal to bring down the churn rate to the minimum. 

## Data Availability: 
* Case_study_data.xlsx: This workbook has two tabs (Active customers and churn customers). 
* Detailed data dictionary for both data sets have been provided as follows 

## EXPECTATIONS: 
 
1.	Understand the data & perform the data preparation before perform all the analysis  
2.	Provide detailed insights/observations based on the analysis  
3.	If you build any statistical model,  a. Understand the output from the software and explain the model fit. b. How would you determine what is the best model? c. Apply transformations to the given variables and find out the possible best model  after transformations d. Generate the final equations  
4.	What are the key factors that predict customer churn? Do these factors make sense?  
5.	Data cleaning including missing values, outliers and multi-collinearity. Describe your  predictive attrition model. How did you select variables to be included in the model?  
6.	What offers should be made to which customers to encourage them to remain with  company? Assume that your objective is to generate net positive cash flow, i.e., generate  additional customer revenues after subtracting out the cost of the incentive.  
7.	Assuming these actions were implemented, how would you determine whether they had  worked?
